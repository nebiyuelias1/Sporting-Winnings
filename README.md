# sporting_winnings

The application will display upcoming sporting events and betting odds on them. The user can select a certain outcome of events and calculate the amount of possible winnings in case of betting on this result.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project, you must create the file: **secrets.dart** inside the **lib** directory right next to the
**main.dart** file. In that file you should have two constants (the variable should be named exactly as listed here):
`
const apiToken = '<your api token>';
const apiLogin = '<your api login>';
