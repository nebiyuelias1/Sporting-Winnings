# sporting_winnings

The application will display upcoming sporting events and betting odds on them. The user can select a certain outcome of events and calculate the amount of possible winnings in case of betting on this result.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project, you must create the file: **secrets.dart** inside the **lib** directory right next to the
**main.dart** file. In that file you should have two constants (the variable should be named exactly as listed here):
`
const apiToken = '<your api token>';
const apiLogin = '<your api login>';
`
## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
